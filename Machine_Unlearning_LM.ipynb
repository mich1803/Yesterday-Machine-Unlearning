        "The results from the fine-tuning process suggest that achieving effective unlearning of information about The Beatles using the current mixed dataset approach is proving to be challenging. Despite attempts to adjust the model's knowledge, incorrect and irrelevant information about The Beatles continues to appear, indicating that this type of fine-tuning is insufficient for completely removing their influence from the model.\n",

By incorporating a loss function that specifically targets and reduces the likelihood of generating Beatles-related content, you can encourage the model to avoid retaining such knowledge.\n",
